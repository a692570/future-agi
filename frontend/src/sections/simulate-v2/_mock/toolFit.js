/**
 * Which agent versions can be tested on which environment versions.
 *
 * Tools belong to the agent version; the world is what answers them. The
 * environment is built from v1, so its world starts out answering exactly v1's
 * tools. A later version can bring a tool the world has never seen — and until
 * the world learns it, every call to that tool goes unanswered and the run
 * scores the agent for the environment's gap.
 *
 * One rule, used everywhere:
 *
 *   an agent version fits an environment version when the world can answer
 *   every tool the agent calls.
 *
 * It is one-directional on purpose. An older agent that calls fewer tools fits
 * a newer world (it simply never calls the extra ones), so re-running v1 on the
 * rebuilt environment is how v1 and v2 get compared on the same test. A newer
 * agent does not fit the older world.
