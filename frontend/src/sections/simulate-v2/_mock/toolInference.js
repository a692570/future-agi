/**
 * Which tools a scenario involves, when it doesn't say.
 *
 * Core scenarios name their tool ("…can only be completed by calling
 * lookup_order"). Rule, trap, adversarial and edge scenarios don't — yet
 * "Refunds above $200 need supervisor approval" is plainly about issuing a
 * refund. This reads the scenario's own words against each tool's name and
 * description and keeps the tools it is clearly about.
 *
 * Words shared by most tools ("order" in a returns world) say nothing about
 * which tool is meant, so a word only counts when at most two tools use it.
 * No dependencies — the run generator and the tool-fit rule both use it, so a
 * scenario's listed tools are the ones its runs exercise.
