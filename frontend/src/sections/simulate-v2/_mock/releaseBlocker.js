/**
 * Release blockers.
 *
 * A scenario is a release blocker when failing it should stop a version
 * shipping no matter how good the pass rate looks. The flag is set when the
 * scenario is written — rule probes, adversarial pressure, forced safety tests
 * and some data traps — but it is the team's call, not ours, so it can be
 * turned on or off per row.
 *
 * An override remembers what the scenario was written as (`criticalWas`), so
 * turning it back restores the original rather than leaving a stale "you
 * changed this" behind, and the reason can still say why it was marked.
